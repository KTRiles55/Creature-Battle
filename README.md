# Description
A fun and interactive C++ program that showcases object-oriented elements, such as class polymorphism and inheritance. It reads from a list of monsters, which create new entities from the Creature class. The user has the option to select two Creature entities from this list and pair them up for a 1v1 battle. Each monster has their own identity and stats (health and strength).
